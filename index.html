Each word of each tweet is highlighted with the weights alpha. 

The page <a target="_blank" href="50_multi_attention.html">Multi-Label Attention Netork</a> includes the same set of tweets, with the emojis from the gold standard (G:) and the predictions (P:) of the multi label attention network. Moreover, by clicking on the emojis on the top, or on the predictions, it is possible to show the attention weights alpha_l of each label.
